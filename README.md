A beginner-friendly **Amazon-style clone** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project was created to practice **DOM manipulation** and simulate basic cart functionality.

## ✨ Features

✅ Add item to cart  
✅ Remove item from cart  
✅ Update order quantity dynamically  
✅ Real-time cart total update  
✅ DOM manipulation using plain JavaScript (no frameworks)

---

## 🛠️ Built With

- **HTML5** – Structure of the page  
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – DOM manipulation and cart logic  

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Understand how to use the **Document Object Model (DOM)** in JavaScript
- Add interactivity to static pages (like updating a cart without reloading)
- Practice event listeners, query selectors, and dynamic updates
- Gain hands-on experience with JavaScript functions, loops, and conditionals

---

## 🚀 How It Works

- Click "Add to Cart" ➜ item is added to cart
- Click "Delete" ➜ item is deleted from the cart
- Quantity ➜ cart total automatically updates

All logic is handled using **vanilla JavaScript** (no external libraries).
